    <h2>Residential projects</h2>
    <p>Do you know that office design affects the production of your employees?!! Of course yes, this is what recent studies have proven. Office design can affect employee performance by 50%. In order to achieve a design that meets the needs of the employees, a comprehensive interior design must be taken into account, including an architectural design that suits the needs of the business and the employees. And not only the performance of employees is affected, but it can affect the number of your customers and their impressions towards your project. There is no doubt that residential projects are the projects most involved in and related to the customer's life, so the decision to own or construct a housing unit is one of the most important decisions that a person takes in his life and greatly affects his present and future. In Ma’an Company, the concept of housing development goes beyond the idea of ​​establishing a residential building with its well-known requirements, because we believe that housing development is to provide an environment that responds to the individual’s needs socially and economically, supports his well-being and success, and is an essential element in his development and increased production. Hence, we decided that our services in this field should go beyond the traditional concept and be part of a clear mission that is to participate in the development of society, support the well-being and stability of its members, and stimulate their communication and integration in the civilizational and cultural development that the country is now undergoing under the banner of the pioneering Vision 2030. The King Salman Park project is the best example to follow in the necessity of achieving a healthy balance between luxury and preserving the environment, as a result of this a developed and productive living society in a distinct way. In view of the rapid development now in the Kingdom, where the number of residential projects in Riyadh, which are under the supervision of the "sakani" initiative, the "sakani" initiativethe "sakani" initiative fects the production fects the production fects the production fects the production. </p>
